# Energy-Efficient Smart Wheel Hoe 🚜  
STM32-Based Embedded Control System for Smart Farming

## Overview
The **Energy-Efficient Smart Wheel Hoe** is an embedded systems project aimed at developing a low-cost, intelligent, and energy-efficient farming aid for small and medium-scale agriculture.  
The system focuses on **motorized soil operation, real-time control, and user interaction**, using an STM32 microcontroller as the core controller.

> ⚠️ **Project Status:** *Under active development*  
> Hardware integration and firmware features are being implemented incrementally.
